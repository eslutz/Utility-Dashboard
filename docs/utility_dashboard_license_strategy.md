# ðŸ“œ License Strategy for Utility Dashboard

This project is **public and source-available**, but commercial use is restricted. We use the **Polyform Noncommercial License** to protect the code while allowing learning, showcasing, and non-commercial contributions.

---

## âœ… Why Polyform Noncommercial?

- Allows **developers and recruiters** to view and learn from your code
- Prevents **others from reselling or hosting your product as a service**
- Ideal for indie developers and solo makers monetizing their own SaaS

## ðŸ”§ How to Add It

### 1. Add a `LICENSE` file to your repo

Paste the full text of the Polyform Noncommercial License into `LICENSE`.

You can customize it by adding:

```
Copyright (c) 2025 Eric Slutz
```

to the top or bottom.

---

### 2. Add a license section to your `README.md`

```markdown
## ðŸ›¡ License

This project is licensed under the [Polyform Noncommercial License](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/).

You are free to view, fork, and modify the code for personal, non-commercial use.

ðŸš« Commercial use â€” including reselling, hosting it as a service, or using it in a paid product â€” requires a separate license.
```

---

### 3. Add a GitHub badge

You can include a license badge like this in your `README.md`:

```markdown
[![License: Polyform Noncommercial](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Polyform%20Noncommercial-blue)](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/)
```

This adds a visual indicator of your licensing status right at the top of the repo.

---

## ðŸ§  Tips

- You can always dual-license or change to a more permissive model later.
- Use this license if you're serious about building a paid product **but still want visibility and dev-friendly workflows**.
